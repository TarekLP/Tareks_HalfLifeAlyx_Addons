# **Survival Waves: Tarek's Custom City Defense**
----------------------------------------------------------

## **The Premise:**
Alyx finds herself trapped in a city block under siege by the relentless Combine forces. She has her wits (and her headphones with some banger music), to do some questionably ethical stuff (including killing Combnie.).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **NoVR Mod**
For those people who play Half Life Alyx using the NoVR mod made by GB_2, this map is compatible the detailed steps will be on the discord if anyone asks there, but a short version goes like this:

Get Source2Viewer
Open the Addon
Extract the map (dont decompile it!)
Put the extracted map into the hlvr/maps Folder
Start NoVR
Open VConsole2.exe and type "map city-defense"
Your Done!
