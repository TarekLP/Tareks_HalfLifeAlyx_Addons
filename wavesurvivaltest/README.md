# Tareks_HalfLifeAlyx_Addons
## **The Premise:**
Alyx is trapped in a small city block that the combine have locked down beforehand.. Alyx needs to survive for as long as possible since the combine are out to get her. Luckily for Alyx, she has her wits (and some headphones for that banger music) to help her while she is doing questionably ethical things.

## **NoVR Mod**
For those people who play Half Life Alyx using the NoVR mod made by GB_2, this map is compatible the detailed steps will be on the discord if anyone asks there, but a short version goes like this:

Get Source2Viewer
Open the Addon
Extract the map (dont decompile it!)
Put the extracted map into the hlvr/maps Folder
Start NoVR
Open VConsole2.exe and type "map city-defense"
Your Done!
